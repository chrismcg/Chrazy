A Max for Live Mopho editor.

ALPHA - Doesn't do anything useful like save with your live set yet.

You can use it to examine existing patches.

Requires Leigh Hunts lh_midi extension to talk NPRN to the Mopho. This makes it Mac only, sorry!

Mac users can download lh_midi from http://web.mac.com/leighhunt/iWeb/Site/downloads.html

PC people, please ask Ableton to allow unrestricted midi access in Live!
